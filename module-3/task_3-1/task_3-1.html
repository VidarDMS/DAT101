    <ol>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[since you are suppose to wake up at 8 o'clock, but you wake up at 7 o'clock you have more time than expected, 
        that why you use a different kind of travel.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[The else if will trigger if the time matches the else if. If it matches the console.log will print the else if answer.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>The code dosen't match if, or else if. And since we have else there it will print out whatever info that is typed inside it, since it dosent
        haven't any other alternatives
      </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>It will type zero if the number is exactly the same the code will trigger the else statement. Since if and else if statement will trigger positive
        or negative in the text. The code runs from the top to the bottom and else is always the last option. So if nothing above matches, it will trigger the else statement </p>
